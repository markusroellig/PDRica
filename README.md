# PDRica
A simple Mathematica PDR model code

PDRs are Photon Dominated Regions in the interstellar medium. A PDR model computes the chemical and thermodynamical balance in these regions and their emission signature (see e.g.  https://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/node/346). 

PDRica is a port of the simple toy PDR model PyPDR written by Simon Bruderer (http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~simonbr/research_pypdr/). This is not meant to be a model for real world applications but to test certain numerical or physical aspects of PDR modelling in a very simple model setup.

So far the package is not yet uploaded. The test notebook contains all the code.
